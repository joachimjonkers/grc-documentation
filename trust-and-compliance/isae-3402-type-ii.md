# ISAE 3402 Type II

An **ISAE 3402 Type II assurance report** is an independent audit report that assesses the effectiveness of a service organization’s internal controls over a specific period, typically related to financial reporting. This report is based on the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3402 and is commonly used by service organizations to demonstrate to clients that they have reliable controls in place.

Key components of an ISAE 3402 Type II report include:

1. **Management Assertion**: A statement from the service organization’s management regarding the controls' design and implementation.
2. **Scope and Objectives**: Defines the systems, processes, and time period covered in the report.
3. **Description of Controls**: An outline of the controls implemented, typically covering areas like access management, data processing, and risk management.
4. **Auditor’s Opinion**: An independent auditor’s opinion on whether the controls are suitably designed and operating effectively over the specified period.
5. **Test Results**: Findings from testing the controls to determine their operational effectiveness, identifying any deficiencies or areas for improvement.

An ISAE 3402 Type II report offers a higher level of assurance than a Type I report by assessing not only the design but also the operating effectiveness of controls over time, giving clients confidence in the service provider’s ability to manage risks associated with financial reporting.
