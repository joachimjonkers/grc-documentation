# Strategic Information Security Policy

Our **strategic information security policy** is a high-level document that outlines our commitment to protecting information assets and managing risks associated with information security. It defines the guiding principles, roles, and responsibilities for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information across our organization. This policy aligns with business objectives and regulatory requirements, setting a framework for decision-making on security matters.

Key elements include:

1. **Scope and Purpose**: Describes the policy's relevance to all information assets, systems, and employees.
2. **Roles and Responsibilities**: Defines who is accountable for security tasks, from executive leadership to end users.
3. **Risk Management Approach**: Outlines how risks are identified, evaluated, and mitigated.
4. **Compliance and Standards**: References relevant standards (e.g., ISO 27001, GDPR) and regulatory compliance requirements.
5. **Enforcement and Review**: States consequences for non-compliance and establishes a schedule for regular review and updates.

This policy provides the foundational direction for all security initiatives and helps ensure a cohesive and proactive security posture organization-wide.
