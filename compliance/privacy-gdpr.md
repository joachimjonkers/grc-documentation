# Privacy / GDPR

A **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)** is a process used to identify and minimize data protection risks in projects or initiatives that involve the processing of personal data, especially when new technologies are involved or when processing could significantly impact individuals' privacy. DPIAs are mandated under regulations like the GDPR when data processing poses high risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals.

Key aspects of a DPIA include:

1. **Purpose**: Identifying the need and objectives of processing personal data.
2. **Data Flow Analysis**: Mapping out data collection, processing, storage, and sharing practices.
3. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating risks to individuals' privacy, such as unauthorized access, loss, or misuse of data.
4. **Mitigation Measures**: Proposing actions to reduce identified risks, like implementing technical safeguards, limiting data access, or anonymizing data where possible.
5. **Documentation and Review**: Keeping records of findings and reviewing the DPIA periodically, especially if processing changes.

Our DPIA helps to ensure compliance with privacy laws, demonstrate accountability, and build trust with users by showing a proactive approach to data protection.
