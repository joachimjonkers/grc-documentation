# Incidents Standing Data

The Incident Standing Data functionality in CERRIX enables users to define and manage reusable data components used when creating and handling incidents. This feature provides flexibility, control, and customization tailored to your organization's specific incident management needs.

This documentation explains how to manage Incident Standing Data, including classifications, incident types, custom fields, and email notifications in CERRIXâ€™s Incident Management module.

### Adding Custom Fields

You can add custom fields to any new incident type:

1. **Create Sections** to logically group custom fields:
   * Name and rearrange sections easily.
   * Remove fields and sections as needed.
2. **Add Fields** within sections:
   * Fields can be configured by:
     * Field Type: Text field, Text area, Date, Date-Time, Number, Checkbox, Dropdown single select, Dropdown multi select, Financial impact.
     * Name
     * Placeholder (optional)
     * Instruction guide text (optional)
     * Visibility status (visible/hidden)
     * Required status (mandatory/optional)
   * Adjust whether fields are required or optional.

**Examples of Adding Custom Fields:**

* **Text area field:** Provide open-ended text inputs.
* **Drop down single select:** Let users select from a predetermined list. Colors can be optionally assigned per choice.
* **Financial Impact:** Numerical data or specific values tailored to your incident reporting needs.

### Configuring Email Notifications

Incident types can trigger notifications to specific recipients upon creation.

To configure notifications per incident type:

2. Navigate to the **Configuration** tab.
3. Add email address(es) for recipients who need notification when an incident with this type is created.

## Standard (Built-in) Incident Types

CERRIX provides two pre-defined incident types for common use cases:

* **Operational Incident**
* **Data Breach**

These built-in incident types:

* Cannot be edited or deleted.
* Guarantee compatibility with pre-established forms and reporting structures.
* Maintain existing data mappings and integration points.

> **Important:** Custom fields cannot yet be added to standard types (e.g., Data Breach). However, this enhancement will be available in future updates.
