2. Configure your filters:
   * Select criteria (e.g., "Reported By," "Creation Date," "Due Date").
   * Specify conditions (e.g., equals, contains, greater than).
   * Example: `Reported By equals [Your Name]` `Due Date greater than [Today]`
3. Click **Preview** to review results before saving.
4. Manage Columns:
   * Choose which columns you want visible or hidden.
   * Adjust column arrangement as desired.

#### Making a Preset Public

To make a preset public in the Incidents Workspace, navigate to **Browse Presets** located at the top left of the navigation menu. In the list of available presets, find the one you want to make public. Next to the preset, you’ll see a button with a globe icon — this represents the option to make the preset public. Clicking this button will publish the preset, making it accessible to all users who have the appropriate permissions to use it.
