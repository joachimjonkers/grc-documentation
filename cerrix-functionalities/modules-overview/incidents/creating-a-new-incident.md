### Completing the Incident Form

When you open a new incident form, several fields are available to capture detailed information. Certain fields are **mandatory** and must be filled out before you save the form.

#### Mandatory Fields:

* **Incident Name**: Provide a concise, descriptive title for easy reference.
* **Date Detected**: Defaults to today’s date. Adjust if needed.
* **Description**: Clearly describe the incident and essential details.
* **Reporting Organization**: Select the organization responsible for reporting this incident.
  * From the dropdown menu, choose your reporting organization (e.g., "Demo Organization").
* **Reporter:** Automatically assigned to the user creating the incident.
* **Assessor:** Select a user to assess and evaluate the incident.
* **Responsible:** Select the person accountable for addressing the incident.

### Assigning Incident Roles

Incident roles clarify responsibilities within your team:

* **Reporter**: Automatically assigned to the user creating the incident.
* **Assessor**: Select a user to assess and evaluate the incident.
* **Responsible**: Select the person accountable for addressing the incident.
* **Informed**: Indicate other users to keep informed about the incident’s progress.

> You can select multiple users for Assessor, Responsible, and Informed roles if needed. Once selected, users can be added or removed easily at any time.

### Setting a Due Date

* The **Due Date** field is optional but beneficial for internal tracking purposes.
* Use this date to indicate when you prefer the incident investigation and resolution workflow to complete.
* Monitoring incident progress against the due date helps maintain timely administration and resolution.

***

### Incident Type and Custom Fields

Selecting an **Incident Type** may activate additional custom fields specific to your organization's configuration.

* Choose your **Incident Type** from the dropdown menu (e.g., "Demo").
* Upon selecting the incident type, extra tabs with custom fields may appear next to the default **"Details"** tab.
* Complete these custom fields as required.

***

### Saving and Validating Your Incident

* After providing all required details, click **"Save"**.
* If mandatory fields are incomplete, the system will prompt you with validation messages highlighting missing information.

Upon successful validation and submission, you will see a confirmation message.
