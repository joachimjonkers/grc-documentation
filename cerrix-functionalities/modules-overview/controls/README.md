# Controls

The Controls Module in CERRIX allows organizations to define, manage, and monitor internal controls related to processes, risks, and compliance frameworks. This guide explains how to create and manage a control, including how to link it to relevant elements such as risks and documentation.

## Purpose of Controls

Controls help ensure that your organization is effectively mitigating risks and complying with relevant standards and frameworks. CERRIX supports various types of controls and enables detailed configuration, classification, and linkage to business elements.
