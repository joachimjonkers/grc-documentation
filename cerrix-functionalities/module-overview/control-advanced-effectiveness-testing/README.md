### Steps for Effectiveness Testing

#### Step 1: Source Document Uploader

2. Click **Upload Source Document**.
3. Drag and drop files or browse to upload relevant documents.
4. Optionally, add a description for the uploaded file.

#### Step 2: Generating Samples

* Choose a sampling method:
  * **By Number**: Generate samples based on a predefined count.
  * **By Date**: Use a date range to generate samples.
  * **By Spreadsheet**: Upload a spreadsheet and configure sample generation.

#### Step 3: Uploading Evidence
