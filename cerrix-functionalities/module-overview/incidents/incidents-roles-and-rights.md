# Incidents Roles & Rights

The Incidents module in CERRIX is built to support collaboration across multiple roles. Each role is designed with specific permissions to ensure the right level of access and responsibility for different users within your organization. Understanding these roles helps configure your incident management process effectively.

## Roles and Permissions

The Incidents module supports ten distinct user roles. Each role defines a set of permissions that grant access to specific parts of the module. Roles must be explicitly assigned to users. To provide broader access or responsibilities, users can be assigned multiple roles simultaneously.
