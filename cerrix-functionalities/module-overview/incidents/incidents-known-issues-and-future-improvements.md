# Incidents: Known Issues & Future Improvements

_Disclaimer: the below planning is based on our current view of the Incidents module. As we release this module to customers, new issues may be identified, and we might shift the priority of certain improvements._

## Planned in the next 3 months

### Known issues

* **\<new>** Notification email addresses for Incident types "Databreach" and "Operational incident" are not saved. Therefore the mails to inform contactpersons that a new incident of this type is created, are not sent.
* If no Responsible or Assessor is assigned, the error is not clearly indicated in screen while trying to save the incident: under assigned users can be added
* PowerBI reports fail for MoIs of the type "Incident". PowerBI will be improved to be able to handle Incident MoIs.
* For the administrators Sent items are not visible yet
* Deleted Users are still visible in the Assigned users component
* For administrators While creating a new dropdown field, editing a dropdown option can result in an empty option that can not be changed. Workaround: Save the new field via " Add field".  Workaround: After saving the component can be improved without any further issue.

### Improvements

* Make workspace better manageable: Enable to select/deselect columns per incident type
* Linked incidents will be shown as linked items in controls, risks and third party module
* The possibility to add hyperlinks to an incident, will be added.
* Exports for incidents including related risks, controls, MOIs and third parties
* Show history. History is stored but cannot yet be viewed.
* API for importing incidents

## Planned in the next 6 months
