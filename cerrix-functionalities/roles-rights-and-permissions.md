# Roles, Rights and Permissions

CERRIX uses a role-based access model to manage who can view, edit, and approve information across the platform. This ensures that every user only has access to the functions and data they need for their responsibilities, supporting both data security and efficient collaboration.

## Roles and Permissions in CERRIX

Each user is assigned one or more roles, which define their level of access. Roles are aligned with common responsibilities in governance, risk, compliance, audit, and incident management. Permissions specify what a role can do within a module.&#x20;

## Permission Matrices per Module

CERRIX provides a Permission Matrix for each key module. These matrices are the authoritative reference for configuring and validating user rights. In the matrix sheet:

* Each row lists a specific action (e.g., _Can report new incidents_, _Can delete risks_).
* Each column represents a role (e.g., Risk Unrestricted Admin, Incident Assessor).
* The cells indicate whether the role has permission, and what the scope of their permission is (_Unrestricted_, _Restricted_, or _Assigned_).
  * Unrestricted means that a user has rights across all organizations
  * Restricted means that a user has rights for a specific organization
