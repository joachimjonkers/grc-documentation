# External Connections

CERRIX enables secure, controlled sharing of control test information and evidence through the External Connections module. This feature is especially useful for auditors or third parties who require direct access to relevant control data and documentation.

## Steps to Set Up External Connection: <a href="#toc188544322" id="toc188544322"></a>

Navigate to the **Administration Controls** menu.

Click on **External Connections.**

| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Description (optional)        | Provide a brief description of the external connection.    |
| Assurance Employee (optional) | Select the person responsible for the external connection. |

Click **Next**

Provide the following details:

| Expiration Date | Specify the date until which the API can be accessed (maximum: 1 year from today).                                   |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IP Restriction  | Enter the IP address from which the API can be accessed. Only API requests from these IP addresses will be accepted. |

### Logging <a href="#toc188544327" id="toc188544327"></a>

CERRIX logs all API calls made for external connections. This ensures users always have an overview of the requested APIs and their respective timestamps. Furthermore, it provides insight into the specific controls that were requested.

* Navigate to the **Administration Controls** menu.
* Click on **Third Party Assurance.**

On this page you can find an overview of all Third Party Assurance connections.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/12.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For each connection, you can access a log of which controls were accessed.
