# AI Settings

The **AI Settings** page allows Application Administrators to enable and manage AI-powered features within the CERRIX environment. These features are designed to enhance functionality across various areas of risk, compliance, audit, and governance.

### Access and Permissions

Only users with the Application Administrator role have access to the AI Settings page. Other user roles will not be able to view or modify these settings.

### Enabling AI Features

To activate CERRIX AI features, Application Administrators must follow these steps:

* **Navigate to the AI Settings** page under Administration Controls.

* **Review and accept the AI Terms and Conditions.**

Enabling AI functionality requires administrators to explicitly acknowledge and accept the terms and conditions associated with the use of AI features in the CERRIX platform.

* **Activate AI functionality.**

Once the terms and conditions are accepted, the CERRIX AI features will be enabled and accessible throughout the application, based on user roles and relevant context.&#x20;

Examples of CERRIX AI functionality include:

{% content-ref url="../cerrix-functionalities/modules-overview/risks/ai-risk-description-refinement.md" %}
[ai-risk-description-refinement.md](../cerrix-functionalities/modules-overview/risks/ai-risk-description-refinement.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../cerrix-functionalities/modules-overview/controls/ai-control-description-refinement.md" %}
[ai-control-description-refinement.md](../cerrix-functionalities/modules-overview/controls/ai-control-description-refinement.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Audit Trail

For transparency and compliance, CERRIX maintains a log of:

* The user who accepted the AI Terms and Conditions.
* The timestamp of when the acceptance occurred.

This information is available for auditing purposes and helps ensure proper governance over the use of AI in your environment.

### Notes

* AI cannot be enabled without accepting the terms and conditions.
* The acceptance is recorded once per environment and applies globally.
