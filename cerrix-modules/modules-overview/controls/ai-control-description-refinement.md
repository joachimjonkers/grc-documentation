# AI Control Description Refinement

## Overview

The Control Description Refinement feature in CERRIX helps users craft clear, comprehensive, and best-practice-aligned control descriptions. By leveraging AI-powered suggestions, users can ensure their control documentation is accurate, structured, and effective.

## How It Works

This feature allows users to refine control descriptions by providing AI-generated suggestions based on an initial input. Users can then choose the best suggestion and apply it to their control record.

## Step-by-Step Guide

#### Access the Control Description Field

* Open an existing control or create a new one within CERRIX.
* Navigate to the Description section of the control entry page.

#### Enter an Initial Risk Description

* Type a brief description of the control in the provided field.
* Example: "Installing fire extinguishers to prevent our office from burning down."

#### Select and Apply a Suggested Description

* Review the generated suggestions and select the one that best represents the risk.
* Click Apply Suggestion to replace the original text with the selected AI-generated description.
* The new description will now be displayed in the control description field.

#### Save the Updated Control Description

* Ensure the refined description accurately captures the control.
* Fill in any other required fields to save the control.
* Click Save control to finalize the control entry.

## Upcoming functionality

In the current version, the AI-powered control description refinement follows a basic template. In our upcoming release, we will enhance this by enforcing a structured template that ensures all key control questions are addressedâ€”covering **when, who, what, how**, and more.

## Benefits of Using AI-Powered Control Descriptions

* Consistency: Ensures control descriptions follow a standardized format.
* Efficiency: Reduces the time needed to craft detailed control descriptions.
* Best Practices Compliance: AI-generated suggestions align with industry standards.

By using the AI Control Description Refinement feature, CERRIX users can improve the quality and clarity of their control documentation, making risk and control management more effective and actionable.
