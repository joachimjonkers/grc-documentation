# Finding Reports

## Finding Reports

### Introduction

A Finding Report in CERRIX documents findings, conclusions, and actions from audits or assessments. It provides a structured approach to:

* Record audit results and observations
* Document underlying risks and root causes
* Link follow-up actions (MoIs) to findings

#### Why Use Finding Reports in CERRIX?

Finding Reports consolidate everything in one place:

* Audit results and assessment scores
* Individual findings and observations
* Improvement measures and follow-up actions
* Status tracking from draft to closure

This consolidation eliminates scattered spreadsheets and email threads. Everything related to an audit exists in a single, searchable location.

#### What You Can Do with Finding Reports

* Create new finding reports for audits or assessments
* Add detailed assessments with scores and ratings
* Link MoIs (Measures of Improvement) to track follow-up
* Generate reports for management or external auditors
* Track resolution status across all findings

#### Finding Report Workflow

Each Finding Report moves through a straightforward workflow:

* **Draft** – Report is being prepared, findings are being documented
* **In Review** – Internal validation and quality check
* **Approved** – Findings are confirmed and accepted
* **Follow-up ongoing** – Linked MoIs are being executed
* **Closed** – All actions complete, audit cycle finished

This workflow ensures findings progress from identification to resolution with clear status visibility.

### Finding Reports Workspace

The Finding Reports workspace provides an overview of all audit reports and findings in your organisation.

#### What You See

The workspace displays all reports with key information:

* **Report Type** – Audit, assessment, review, or other category
* **Responsible** – Who owns the report
* **Auditor** – Who conducted the audit
* **Status** – Current workflow stage
* **Score** – Overall rating or assessment outcome
* **Due date** – When follow-up actions should be complete

#### Workspace Functions

**Advanced configuration** opens detailed filter options. Search by:

* Report type (internal audit, external audit, self-assessment)
* Status (draft, in review, approved, closed)
* Responsible party or auditor
* Date ranges
* Assessment scores or ratings

**Table configuration** controls which columns appear in the list. Show only the information relevant to your current task.

**Preset management** saves your filter and column settings:

* Click **+** to save a preset with a descriptive name (e.g., "Open Audits – My Department")
* Click \*\*\*\*\* to set a default preset that loads automatically

### Creating a Finding Report

#### How to Get Started

1. Navigate to the **Finding Reports workspace**
2. Click **Add finding report** in the top right corner

You'll be presented with a form to capture the core report information.

#### Essential Information

**Report type** – Select the category that best describes your audit:

* Internal audit
* External audit
* Self-assessment
* Compliance review
* Risk assessment
* Other (specify)

**Report number** – Enter your internal or external audit reference number. This helps track the report across systems and makes it easy to reference in meetings or correspondence.

**Object name** – Describe the subject or entity being audited:

* Department name
* Process (e.g., "Accounts Payable Process")
* System (e.g., "HR Information System")
* Location or business unit

Be specific so users immediately understand what was assessed.

#### Roles and Responsibilities

**Responsible** – The person accountable for addressing findings and implementing improvements. This is often a department head or process owner, not the auditor.

**Auditor** – The person or team who conducted the audit and documented findings. They maintain oversight of follow-up actions.

#### Audit Context

**Scope & Objective** – Explain what was included in the audit:

* Which processes, systems, or controls were reviewed
* What the audit was trying to achieve
* What risks or compliance requirements were evaluated
* What was explicitly excluded from scope

Clear scope prevents confusion about what was and wasn't assessed.

**Conclusion** – Summarise the overall findings:

* Were controls adequate and effective?
* What significant gaps or weaknesses were identified?
* What is the overall risk rating or assessment outcome?
* What are the key priorities for improvement?

The conclusion should be executive-level summary that captures the essence of the audit without requiring readers to review every detail.

#### Supporting Documents

Attach relevant files such as:

* Complete audit reports
* Work papers
* Evidence files
* Methodology documentation
* External auditor reports

Documents remain accessible throughout the finding report lifecycle and provide supporting detail for assessments and MoIs.

#### Saving the Report

Click **Save** to create the finding report. It now appears in the Finding Reports workspace and is ready for you to add assessments and improvement measures.

### Adding Assessments to a Finding Report

An Assessment represents a specific finding or observation within the broader Finding Report. You can add multiple assessments to capture individual control failures, process gaps, or compliance issues.

#### Why Use Assessments?

Assessments provide granular detail. Instead of one overall audit score, you might have:

* Access control assessment (score: 3/5)
* Change management assessment (score: 4/5)
* Data backup assessment (score: 2/5)
* Incident response assessment (score: 3/5)

This granularity shows exactly where strengths and weaknesses lie.

#### How to Add an Assessment

1. Open an existing Finding Report
2. Navigate to the **Assessments** tab
3. Click **Add assessment**

Complete the assessment details:

**Assessment date** – When was this specific finding observed or evaluated?

**Assessment type** – Categorise the assessment:

* Operational
* IT/Technical
* Compliance
* Financial
* Data protection/privacy
* Security

**Score** – Select the outcome:

* Numerical rating (1-5 scale, where 5 is excellent)
* Descriptive rating (Effective, Needs improvement, Inadequate)
* Pass/Fail
* Custom scoring based on your organisation's methodology

Choose the scoring approach that aligns with your audit framework.

**Assessor** – Who performed this specific assessment? This might be different from the overall Auditor if multiple team members contributed to different sections.

**Comments** – Provide detail about the finding:

* What specifically was observed or tested
* Why this represents a concern or strength
* What evidence supports the assessment
* Any relevant context or mitigating factors

Good comments help readers understand not just the score but the reasoning behind it.

#### Saving the Assessment

Click **Save** to add the assessment to the finding report. You can add as many assessments as needed to fully document all findings from the audit.

#### Viewing All Assessments

The Assessments tab shows all individual assessments in a list, making it easy to:

* Compare scores across different areas
* Identify patterns (e.g., all IT controls scored low)
* Prioritise improvement efforts
* Generate detailed reports for stakeholders

### Linking MoIs to Finding Reports

Every significant finding should lead to one or more improvement actions. MoIs provide the structured follow-up mechanism.

#### When to Create MoIs

Create MoIs for findings that require action, such as:

* Control deficiencies that need remediation
* Process gaps requiring procedure updates
* Training needs
* Technology improvements
* Policy changes

Not every finding needs an MoI. Minor observations or positive findings typically don't require formal improvement actions.

#### How to Link MoIs

1. Open the Finding Report
2. Navigate to the **Linked Measures of Improvement** tab
3. Click **Add MoI**
4. Complete the MoI details following the structure described in the Measures of Improvement training:
   * Name and description of the improvement
   * Responsible party and reviewer
   * Due date and priority
   * Expected outcomes
5. Click **Save MoI**

The MoI is now linked to the finding report and visible in both locations.

#### Tracking Follow-Up

Once MoIs are created and linked:

* The Auditor can monitor progress via the Finding Report
* Status updates in the MoI automatically reflect in finding report views
* Deadlines and priorities help ensure timely resolution
* Completion of all MoIs enables finding report closure

#### Closing the Loop

When all linked MoIs are completed and accepted:

1. The Auditor reviews whether findings have been adequately addressed
2. The Finding Report status can progress to "Closed"
3. The audit cycle is complete with documented evidence of resolution

This closed-loop process demonstrates that findings weren't just noted but actually resolved.

***

### Best Practices

#### Write Clear, Actionable Findings

Good findings are specific and actionable. Compare:

**Weak:** "Access control needs improvement"

**Strong:** "15 terminated employees retained active network accounts for an average of 23 days after departure, creating unauthorised access risk"

The strong finding provides concrete evidence and explains the risk, making it clear why action is needed.

#### Use Consistent Scoring

Within an audit, apply scoring consistently. If a score of "3" means "adequate but needs minor improvement," use that definition for every assessment. Inconsistent scoring makes reports difficult to interpret.

#### Link Findings to Risks and Controls

When you create assessments, reference specific risks or controls that are affected. This creates traceability between your finding reports and your risk register, making it easy to see how audit results inform risk management.

#### Set Realistic Due Dates for MoIs

When creating improvement actions, work with the Responsible party to establish achievable deadlines. Overly aggressive dates lead to missed commitments and erode confidence. Overly generous dates reduce urgency. Find the balance.

#### Document Management Response

For each significant finding, capture how management intends to respond. This might be:

* Agreement to implement the recommendation
* Acceptance of the risk with justification
* Disagreement with the finding (with supporting rationale)

Management response demonstrates accountability and helps auditors understand organisational priorities and constraints.

#### Close Reports When Complete

Once all MoIs are resolved and the audit cycle is finished, close the finding report. Open reports from completed audits make it difficult to understand what still requires attention.

Closed reports remain accessible for reference and demonstrate your organisation's audit resolution track record.

### Reporting and Analysis

Finding Reports enable powerful reporting capabilities:

#### Trend Analysis

Track findings over time:

* Are the same issues appearing in multiple audits?
* Are scores improving or declining?
* Which departments have the most findings?

Trends reveal systemic issues that need strategic attention.

#### Priority Identification

Generate reports showing:

* All open findings by priority
* Overdue MoIs linked to findings
* Departments with the most critical findings

This helps leadership allocate resources to the highest-priority improvements.

#### Audit Evidence

Finding Reports provide audit trail evidence showing:

* What was assessed and when
* What findings emerged
* What actions were taken
* When resolution was achieved

This documentation is invaluable during regulatory examinations or external audits.

### Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Create a New Finding Report

1. Create a Finding Report for a fictional audit in your training environment
2. Complete the fields:
   * Report Type: Internal Audit
   * Responsible: Assign to yourself or a training colleague
   * Auditor: Assign an auditor role
   * Scope & Objective: Describe what you're auditing (e.g., "Review of access control procedures in HR system")
   * Conclusion: Write a brief overall assessment
3. Save the report

#### Exercise 2: Add Assessments

1. Open your Finding Report
2. Add at least two assessments with different types and scores:
   * Assessment 1: Type = IT, Score = 3/5, Comments = specific finding
   * Assessment 2: Type = Compliance, Score = 4/5, Comments = specific finding
3. Save each assessment
4. Review the Assessments tab to see your findings listed

#### Exercise 3: Link an MoI

1. Navigate to the **Linked Measures of Improvement** tab
2. Create a new MoI or link an existing one
3. Ensure the MoI has:
   * Clear description of required improvement
   * Assigned Responsible party
   * Realistic due date
4. Verify the link is visible in both the Finding Report and the MoI workspace
5. Track the MoI through its workflow until closure
