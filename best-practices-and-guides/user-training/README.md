# User Training

## Welcome to the CERRIX User Training

### What is CERRIX?

CERRIX is an integrated GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) platform that helps your organisation manage risks, implement controls, and demonstrate compliance. Instead of working with scattered spreadsheets and disconnected systems, CERRIX brings everything together in one place.

This training will guide you through the core modules and show you how to use CERRIX effectively in your daily work.

### The CERRIX Approach

CERRIX follows a continuous improvement cycle that forms the foundation of effective risk management:

**Risk → Control → Execution → Testing → Improvement**

> 🖼️ **\[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: The GRC Cycle Diagram]** Show visual representation of the complete cycle with arrows connecting each stage

Understanding this cycle helps you see how different parts of CERRIX work together:

1. **Identify risks** that could impact your organisation
2. **Implement controls** to manage those risks
3. **Execute controls** consistently and document the work
4. **Test effectiveness** to verify controls are working
5. **Drive improvements** when gaps or failures are discovered

Then the cycle repeats, with each iteration strengthening your risk management capability.

***

### Core Modules Overview

#### Risks

Document what could go wrong, assess severity, and link to mitigation measures. Risks provide the foundation for everything else in CERRIX.

#### Controls

Define and document the measures that reduce or eliminate risks. Controls are your organisation's defence against risk materialisation.

#### Control Testing

Prove that controls are properly designed and actually working. Testing creates confidence and identifies areas needing improvement.

This module includes three components:

* **Design & Implementation (D\&I) Testing** – Verify controls are correctly configured
* **Control Execution** – Document control operation and create audit trails
* **Effectiveness Testing** – Confirm controls work as intended in practice

#### Measures of Improvement (MoIs)

Track actions that address gaps, findings, or failures. MoIs ensure that problems lead to solutions, not just reports.

#### Incidents

Register and investigate events when things go wrong. Incidents provide learning opportunities and trigger preventive actions.

#### Finding Reports

Document audit results, assessments, and required follow-up actions. Finding Reports create accountability for resolving issues.

#### Data Management

Manage data processing activities for GDPR compliance and privacy risk management. This module documents what data you process, why, and how you protect it.

***

### How Modules Connect

CERRIX modules aren't separate tools – they work together to create a complete risk management system.

> 🖼️ **\[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Module Integration Diagram]** Visual showing connections: Risks ↔ Controls ↔ Testing ↔ MoIs, with Incidents and Audits feeding into the cycle

**Risks link to Controls** – Show which controls mitigate which risks

**Controls link to Testing** – Execution records feed into effectiveness testing

**Test results link to MoIs** – Failed tests trigger improvement actions

**Incidents link to MoIs** – Root causes lead to preventive measures

**Audits link to everything** – Finding Reports pull together risks, controls, test results, and required improvements

**Data processing links to risks and controls** – Privacy risks are managed like any other risk

These connections create traceability. You can follow a chain from initial risk identification through to final resolution, with evidence at every step.

### Navigating the CERRIX Interface

> 📹 **\[VIDEO PLACEHOLDER: CERRIX Navigation Basics - 3 minutes]**

> * Opening workspaces
> * Understanding the workspace layout
> * Switching between organisations

#### Main Navigation

The left-hand navigation menu provides access to all CERRIX modules. Click on any module name to open its workspace.

> 🖼️ **\[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Main Navigation Menu]** Annotate: Point to each module in the navigation (Risks, Controls, Testing, MoIs, Incidents, Finding Reports, Data Management)

#### Workspaces

Workspaces are your main views of data. Each module has a workspace showing all relevant items (risks, controls, incidents, etc.).

> 🖼️ **\[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Example Workspace View]** Annotate:
>
> * "List of items with key information"
> * "Filter and configuration buttons at top"
> * "Action buttons (add new, export, etc.)"
> * "Click any row to open details"

Every workspace includes:

* **A data table** with rows for each item
* **Filter buttons** at the top (advanced configuration, table configuration)
* **Action buttons** like "add new risk" or "add new control"
* **Export options** to download data

***

### Filtering and Configuration (Used in All Workspaces)

Every workspace in CERRIX offers powerful filtering and configuration options. Learning these once helps you work efficiently everywhere.

> * Opening advanced configuration
> * Applying filters to columns
> * Saving and managing presets
> * Setting a default preset

#### Applying Filters

1. Click **advanced configuration** to open the filter panel
2. Each column can be filtered individually
3. Select your filter criteria (equals, contains, date ranges, etc.)
4. Click **apply configuration** to refresh the view

> 🖼️ **\[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Advanced Configuration Panel]** Annotate:
>
> * "advanced configuration button"
> * "Filter options for each column"
> * "apply configuration button"

#### Customising Table Columns

1. Click **table configuration**
2. Select which columns to show or hide
3. This helps you focus on relevant information
4. Click **apply configuration**

#### Saving Presets

Presets save your filter and column settings for reuse:

1. Configure your filters and columns as desired
2. Click **preset management**
3. Enter a descriptive preset name
4. Click **+** to save the preset

> 🖼️ **\[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Preset Management Interface]** Annotate:
>
> * "preset management button"
> * "Name field for new preset"
> * "+ button to save"
> * "\* button to set as default"

#### Setting a Default Preset

1. Open **preset management**
2. Select your preferred preset from the list
3. Click \*\*\*\*\* (star icon) next to **default preset**
4. This preset will load automatically when you open the workspace

#### Managing Presets

To delete a preset:

1. Open **preset management**
2. Select the preset under **manage presets**
3. Click **X** to remove it

***

### Common Tasks Across All Modules

#### Creating New Items

Most modules follow a similar pattern for creating new items:

1. Open the relevant workspace
2. Click the "add new" button (e.g., "add new risk", "add new control")
3. Fill in required fields
4. Link to related items if needed
5. Click **save**

> 🖼️ **\[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Create New Item Form]** Show a typical "add new" form with required fields marked

#### Linking Items Together

CERRIX uses a consistent linking interface across modules:

1. Open the item you want to link from
2. Navigate to the appropriate tab (e.g., "Linked controls", "Linked risks")
3. Click **Link panel**
4. Browse or search for items to link
5. Drag items into the linked area or click to select
6. Click **save**

> 🖼️ **\[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Link Panel in Action]** Annotate:
>
> * "Link panel button"
> * "Available items to link"
> * "Drag or click to select"
> * "save button"

#### Viewing History and Audit Trail

Every item in CERRIX maintains a complete history:

1. Open any item
2. Click the **History** tab
3. View all changes with timestamps and user names
4. See status progressions and field updates

This audit trail is essential for compliance and troubleshooting.
