# Control Execution, Design & Implementation & Effectiveness Testing: What's the Difference?

In the CERRIX platform, controls are a central component of your governance, risk, and compliance framework. Understanding the different types of control activities and testing phases is essential for effective risk mitigation and assurance.

This article explains the differences between **Control Execution**, **Control Design & Implementation Testing**, and **Control Effectiveness Testing**.

***

## Control Execution

**Definition**:\
Control execution refers to the **actual performance** of a control activity by the responsible party or system, according to its defined frequency and procedure.

**Purpose**:\
Ensure that the control is carried out as designed, on time, and by the appropriate stakeholder.

**Example**:\
A weekly review of user access logs performed by an IT administrator.

**In CERRIX**:\
Control execution is logged through the **Control Monitoring** module. Control owners receive automated tasks or notifications to perform and evidence control activities.

***

## Control Design & Implementation Testing

**Definition**:\
This is a test of the **suitability and proper setup** of the control. It determines whether the control, as designed and implemented, is capable of addressing the associated risk.

**Purpose**:\
To assess whether the control is appropriate and has been set up correctly within business processes or IT systems.

**Example**:\
Reviewing if a purchase approval workflow enforces segregation of duties between requester and approver.

**In CERRIX**:\
Documented in the **Control Library** or during **Control Assessment** workflows, often by second or third line teams (Compliance, Audit). Testing results are stored and linked to the control for transparency and auditability.

***

## Control Advanced Effectiveness Testing

**Definition**:\
This test checks whether the control **operates effectively over time**. It involves reviewing historical evidence to confirm that the control consistently works as intended.

**Purpose**:\
To validate that the control not only exists but also reliably mitigates the associated risk.

**Example**:\
Sampling the past 6 months of control executions to verify timely and complete access reviews were performed.

**In CERRIX**:\
Performed through the **Control Advanced Effectiveness Testing** feature, allowing testers to upload sampling results, attach evidence, and rate control performance (e.g., effective, partially effective, ineffective).

## Summary Table

| Activity                            | Focus Area              | Key Question                                              | Typical Role          |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Control Execution**               | Operational Delivery    | _Was the control performed as required?_                  | Control Owner         |
| **Design & Implementation Testing** | Setup & Appropriateness | _Is the control well-designed and implemented correctly?_ | Risk/Compliance/Audit |
| **Effectiveness Testing**           | Performance Assurance   | _Is the control working reliably over time?_              | Compliance/Audit      |

## Best Practices

* Ensure roles and responsibilities are clearly defined in the **Control Owner** field in Cerrix.
* Use **automation** to schedule recurring control executions and reminders.
* Link testing activities to relevant risks, processes, and audits for traceability.
* Leverage **AI Assistance** in Cerrix to prefill control descriptions and suggest test procedures based on best practices.
