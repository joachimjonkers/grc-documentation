# Release Planning

At CERRIX, we follow a regular release planning cycle to ensure our customers receive improvements, new features, and updates.

## **Release Types**

We operate with two types of releases:

### **Acceptance (ACC) Environment Release**

*   **Purpose:**

    Updates are deployed to the Acceptance (ACC) environment for internal validation and customer acceptance testing.
*   **Frequency:**

    Currently every 3 weeks.

### **Production (PRD) Environment Release**

*   **Purpose:**

    Fully validated updates are deployed to the Production (PRD) environment, making them available to all users.
*   **Frequency:**

    Currently every 6 weeks
