# Support Ticket Status

The latest status of a ticket can always be viewed on the customer portal. Here, you can also add additional questions or information to a ticket.

After creating a ticket, the customer receives a confirmation email containing a unique ticket number. This ticket number must be mentioned when contacting support so that the relevant employee can quickly locate and update the correct ticket with the latest information.

A ticket can have one of the following statuses:

<table><thead><tr><th valign="top">Status</th><th valign="top">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">New</td><td valign="top">A newly submitted ticket receives the status Intake, meaning the intake process will still take place.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Intake completed</td><td valign="top">When the intake process is completed and the ticket is ready to be processed, its status changes to Intake Completed. At this point, the SLA resolution time starts.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">In progress</td><td valign="top">The <em>In Progress</em> status means investigation, reproduction, analysis, or implementation work is underway. The SLA resolution time continues to run while the ticket is in this status.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">With CERRIX</td><td valign="top">The With CERRIX status is used when the next action on the ticket lies with CERRIX, but the work has not yet started or resumed. Examples include tickets returned to CERRIX after a user response, internal handovers, or pending prioritization. The SLA resolution time continues to run while the ticket is in this status.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">With user</td><td valign="top">If additional information is required from the reporter/user, the ticket status is set to With User, and the resolution time is paused. The inquiry takes place via the customer portal to ensure clear and well-documented communication.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">With supplier</td><td valign="top">If tasks need to be performed by an external party, the ticket status is set to Waiting for Supplier. In this case, the resolution time continues to run.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Awaiting confirmation</td><td valign="top">When the issue has been addressed and the solution has been implemented, the ticket status changes to <em>Completed</em>. At this point, CERRIX awaits confirmation from the customer or a predefined waiting period before the ticket is closed. The SLA resolution time stops when the ticket reaches this status.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Closed</td><td valign="top"><p>When CERRIX considers a ticket to be fully resolved, the status changes to Closed.</p><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table>

When the status of a ticket is updated, the customer receives a notification via email.
