## How to Use CERRIX Documentation

### Welcome to CERRIX Docs

This documentation is designed to help you find answers quickly and easily. Whether you're looking for step-by-step instructions, understanding a specific feature, or troubleshooting an issue, we've made it simple to get the information you need.

### The AI-Powered Search Bar

At the top right of every documentation page, you'll find a **search bar powered by AI**. This is your fastest way to find answers.

#### How It Works

Simply type your question in natural language - just as you would ask a colleague. The AI understands your question and provides relevant answers from the documentation.

**Example:**

* Type: "how can I unlink a risk"
* Get instant answer: "You can unlink a risk by removing it from the control's Risks linkage. Open the control in the Controls module, then use the left-hand linking panel..."

#### Ask Questions Freely

You don't need to know exact terminology or use specific keywords. The AI search understands:

**Natural questions:**

* "How do I add a new risk?"
* "What's the difference between Responsible and Delegate?"
* "Where can I see all my third parties?"
* "How can I remove a control from a risk?"

**Action-based queries:**

* "Create a measure of improvement"
* "Link a control to a risk"
* "Filter risks by department"
* "Export third party list"

**Feature exploration:**

* "What is criticality in third parties?"
* "How does the review process work?"
* "What are framework dimensions?"
* "Explain GDPR data processor requirements"



### When to Use AI Search vs Browse

#### Use AI Search when:

* You have a specific question or task
* You want a quick answer without reading full pages
* You're troubleshooting an issue
* You know what you want to do but not where to find it
* You want to understand a specific concept

**Examples:**

* "How do I change the review frequency of a third party?"
* "What happens when I mark a third party as Data processor?"
* "Can I link multiple risks to one control?"

#### Browse the documentation when:

* You're learning CERRIX for the first time
* You want to understand a complete workflow
* You're looking for best practices
* You want to see all available options in a module
* You prefer structured, comprehensive learning

### What You Can Ask About

The AI search covers all aspects of CERRIX, including the Risks, Controls, Measures of Improvement (MoIs), Incidents, Third Party Management, and Data Management modules. You can ask about creating and managing items in any module, workflows and status changes, linking between modules, testing and effectiveness, and compliance topics like GDPR and DORA. General topics are also covered, such as user roles and permissions, workspace filtering and presets, framework and business dimensions, history and audit trails, and document management. Whether you need step-by-step instructions, want to understand a specific feature, or are looking for compliance guidance, the AI search can help you find answers across the entire CERRIX platform.

### Understanding AI Answers

When the AI provides an answer, it will:

1. **Give you direct instructions** for how to accomplish your task
2. **Reference specific locations** in CERRIX (e.g., "Open the control in the Controls module")
3. **Provide context** about what happens when you take an action
4. **Link to relevant documentation pages** for more detailed information

**Example response:**

> "You can unlink a risk by removing it from the control's **Risks** linkage. Open the control in the **Controls** module, then use the left-hand linking panel. In **Linking a Control**, CERRIX lets you associate a control with **Risks** (alongside Processes, Frameworks, Documents, and Hyperlinks). To unlink, go to that **Risks** linkage and remove the risk from the control's linked risks list. See: Controls."

Notice how it:

* Tells you exactly what to do
* Specifies where to go ("Controls module", "left-hand linking panel")
* Explains what you'll find there
* References the documentation section for more details

### If You Don't Find What You Need

If the AI search doesn't answer your question:

1. **Try rephrasing:** Sometimes asking the same question differently helps
   * Instead of: "third party removal"
   * Try: "How do I delete a third party?"
2. **Be more specific:** Add details about what you're trying to accomplish
   * Instead of: "contracts"
   * Try: "How do I add a contract to a third party?"
3. **Browse related sections:** Use the left navigation to explore the relevant module documentation
4. **Check for related questions:** The AI might suggest related topics that lead to your answer

### Quick Start Examples

Here are some common questions to get you started:

**Getting Started:**

* "How do I create my first risk?"
* "Where do I register a new incident?"
* "How do I add a third party?"

**Understanding Features:**

* "What is the difference between Responsible and Delegate?"

* "How does control testing work?"

**Working with Workflows:**

* "What is the incident investigation workflow?"
* "How do I close a measure of improvement?"

**Linking and Integration:**

* "How do I link a control to a risk?"
